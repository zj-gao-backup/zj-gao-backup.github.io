- title: Research Areas
  type: list
  contents:
  - My research focuses on developing algorithms for machine learning, mainly focused on semi-supervised learning, curriculum learning, multitask learning, and graph-based problems.
  - I am also interested in creating AI agents that can understand language and reason, therefore I have also worked on natural language processing with a focus on question answering and problem solving.
  - I have also worked on machine learning methods for neuroscience, with the goal of understanding how the human brain understands language and controls speech.
