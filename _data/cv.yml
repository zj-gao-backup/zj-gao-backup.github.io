- title: Research Areas
  type: list
  contents:
    - My PhD research focuses on developing machine learning methods applied in neuroscience, with the goal of understanding how the brain understands language and controls speech.
    - I am also passionate about drawing inspiration from the human brain and intuition in order to develop new methods for machine learning (mainly focused on semi-supervised and curriculum learning).
    - I am also interested in creating AI agents that can understand language and reason, therefore I am also working on natural language processing with a focus on question answering and problem solving.
